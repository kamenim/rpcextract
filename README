rpcextract 0.99

NAME
     rpcextract -- rpc filter and payload extractor

SYNOPSIS
     rpcextract -i <pcap file> | -l <device> [-v] [-d <outdir>] [-p <proto_name#1>] [-p <proto_name#2>] ...

DESCRIPTION
     RPCExtract is a tool that can filter out specific RPC packets from a
     pcap file or from a live packet capture session, based on an interface
     name. The payload found in the selected RPC packets is then extracted
     to separate files for later analyze.

     It is based only on the pcap library, "libpcap", since last version.
     (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpcap/)

     RPCExtract was initially written for the OpenChange project (www.openchange.org).

     The options are as follows:

     -i      
	     The pcap file to treat. Incompatible with -l.

     -l device
             Specify a network device, on which packets while be captured (in non promiscous
	     mode) and treated.

     -v      Verbose option

     -d outdir
	     Directory where payloads files while be stored. If this one doesn't, it will be
  	     created.

     -p proto_name#N
	     Add an RPC Over protocol to filter. Static protocols managed in this version are
	     "Nspi" and "Mapi" (EMSMDB).

     Command Line Exemples :

     *	    ./rpcextract -i ~/PCAP -d res1c -p Mapi -p Nspi
            
	    Will extract from ~/PCAP file, all Mapi and Nspi packets, and will store paylods files in
            the ./res1c directory.

     *	    ./rpcextract -v -l eth0 -d live

	    Will store every Mapi or Nspi packet that will be listened on the eth0 interface, payload
	    file in the ./live directory.

     *	    ./rpcextract -v -i ~/PCAP -p Nspi

	    Will store every Nspi packet payload file in current directory.

     Payloads filename is formatted as follows:

     {PACKET NUMBER}_{PACKET TYPE (IN/OUT)}_{OVER RPC PORTOCOL NAME (NSPI/MAPI)}_{PROTOCOL'S FUNCTION NAME}
